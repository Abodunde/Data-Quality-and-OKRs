# Data-Quality-and-OKRs

Data quality analysis involves assessing the accuracy, completeness, consistency, and reliability of data to ensure that it meets the requirements for its intended use. It is a crucial process in data management and analytics, as the quality of data directly impacts the reliability and effectiveness of insights and decisions derived from it.

In this repository, I implement data quality logic from scratch using procedural programming. Afterwards, data points that do not meet data quality standards are extracted from the dataset and the distribution of the issues are visualized using the PowerBI file. This PowerBI file is named "Data Quality Visualisation".pbix in the folder.

NB: The code might be a bit inefficient as it was written couple of years back but the overall logic stays the same.

Hope you find this informative.
